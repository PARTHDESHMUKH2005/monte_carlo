# Monte Carlo Project
This project uses Monte Carlo simulation to solve a real-world uncertainty problem by repeatedly generating random samples and estimating outcomes through statistical averaging. Randomness is modeled using probability distributions, and the simulated data is treated as a dataset for analysis. Machine learning is integrated using a Random Forest model, which is trained on the simulated data to learn non-linear relationships and predict outcomes more efficiently than repeated simulations, helping reduce computation time and variance. From a data science perspective, the project involves data generation, feature selection, supervised learning, model evaluation, and visualization of distributions and convergence behavior. The OpenAI API was used to generate short, high-level insights from simulation outputs—such as identifying high-risk vs low-risk scenarios and summarizing trends—by converting numerical results into concise, human-readable interpretations.
